# Bug_Reports

This repository includes bug report samples that I wrote for several real webpages to identify and document issues that affect their functionality. These reports cover a range of bugs, including UI glitches, performance problems, and functional errors, along with detailed steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and suggestions for fixing the issues.
